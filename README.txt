DESCRIPTION

  The LIME IPTV Portal provides an open entry point for the development of
  applications or sites for Next Generation Connected TVs now available in
  Japan and other countries.

  I started this project after winning a Best Application award at the IPTV
  Application Challenge [2] organized by ITU-T, for the "7 Days Gallery" [3],
  designed in collaboration with the artist Alève Mine.
